### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Michael McQuade

I'm currently pursuing a M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Houston and working as a Software Engineer at [Parallel Works](https://parallelworks.com).

I am interested in contributing to open source projects and love the idea of working in the open. I am also open for freelance work. If you want to reach me, email me at michael@giraffesyo.io
